Number Theoretic Functions

	Tao Function is a function which is defined as outputing number of divisors of an input n.

	Sigma function is a function which given two value n and k will provide sum of divisors of n raised to the power of k

	Two numbers are called coprimes if GCD of two numbers are 1. 
 	Euler's Pi function is a function that given a number n will give amount of numbers below n coprime to n.

Above I have given textbook definition of three functions. Now Tao function have been constructed as described. But in other two functions i have included another variable called "ask" which will want to see what user wants.
User may want to see list of divisors or coprimes. By giving count as input in ask user will get sum or number of coprimes and by giving list as input in ask user will get list of coprimes or numbers that are raised to power k.
